# 🌐 Responsive Landing Page

This is a simple, responsive landing page built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It was created as part of the Day 1 onboarding task for my internship at **Elevate Labs**.

## 🚀 Objective

The goal of this task was to build a clean, responsive landing page with the following sections:

- ✅ Header with brand/logo and navigation
- ✅ Hero section with a headline, description, and call-to-action (CTA) button
- ✅ Footer with basic copyright

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox + Media Queries for responsiveness)

## 📱 Responsive Design

This landing page is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes using CSS media queries. The layout adjusts for smaller screens by stacking elements vertically.

## 🧱 File Structure

```
project-root/
├── index.html      # Main HTML page
├── styles.css      # Stylesheet with responsive layout
└── README.md       # Project overview and instructions
```

## 🖥️ Preview
